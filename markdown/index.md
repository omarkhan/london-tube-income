[This feature in the New Yorker][1] shows median household income across the
city's subway network. It shows some serious inequality: line 2 rises from the
lowest depths of $13,750 at East 180 St. in the Bronx to the staggering heights
of $205,192 at Park Place in downtown Manhattan.

[Dan Grover][2] put together [a similar visualization for the San Francisco bay
area][3]. Turns out the bay area is pretty unequal too: in a single CalTrain
stop, median annual income plummets from $193,125 at Atherton to just $30,080
at Redwood City.

I was curious what this kind of visualization would look like for my city,
London. The surprising result: while there is considerable inequality, it
doesn't come close to the factor-of-10 gap you can find in NY and SF. I suspect
part of it has to do with differences in the datasets &ndash; the figures I'm
using here are model-based estimates of weekly household income.
